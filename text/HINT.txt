NOTES

- To make any of these consonants "ejective", add a ! (b!, d!, g!, k!, p!, t!).
- To make any consonant aspirated, add an "h~" after it as in bh~, dh~, etc..
- To make any consonant palatalized (y sound after), add an "y~" after it as in by~, dy~, etc..
- Some other sounds are "dj" (hard j sound), "ts", "t!s", "k!w", "tx" (english ch sound), etc.
- For tones, you simply add one static tone to each vowel. So high-low-high tone is 3 vowels like "a+a-a+".
- Ask me about click sounds if you are doing African Bantu languages (Zulu, Xhosa, etc.). You can hear them by clicking the audio on the top right on the Wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant
- Capital letters DO NOT correspond to stronger emphasis.
- To make a long vowel sound, add an underscore _ after the vowel.
- To make a long consonant sound, add a second consonant (for geminated consonants), like rr or gg.
- The capital vowels have these sounds: A = cat, E = pet, I = pit, O = book, U = but.
- You can make prolonged consonants by doubling them (tt, dd, etc.).

TONES

For Thai, the tones are as follows:

mid (no mark)
low = a-
falling = a+a-
high = a+
rising = a-a

EXAMPLES

measure = mE^jr
hi = hay
love = lUv
fair = fEr
fire = fayr
share = xEr
chip = txIp
judge = djUdj
wood = wOd
cool = kul
cat = kAt
dog = dag
dont = downt
do = du
drug = drUg
pit = pIt
dunk = dUqk
sing = siq
think = ciqk
these = Ciz

To add the emphasis/accent, always add it on a vowel, so like this: measure = mE^jr. Add it by adding the ^ after the last vowel.
